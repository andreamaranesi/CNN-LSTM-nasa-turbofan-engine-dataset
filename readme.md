## NASA TURBOFAN JET ENGINE DATASET

Starting from the 2021 PHM challenge (https://data.phmsociety.org/2021-phm-conference-data-challenge/), me and [Alessandro Muscatello](https://github.com/AlessandroMuscatello) have developed a CNN-LSTM model, using PyTorch, to predict RULs.

All the files used, from the dataset to the weights of the various models, are present in the following Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KYUY9S1VIzrVmUpgrBatnW6WVDhoS5Ug?usp=share_link <br>
Inside, you can find two folders named **dataset** and **dumps**: the first contains the .h5 files of the dataset, and the model weights; the second contains files needed for clustering, and the training and validation tensors.
